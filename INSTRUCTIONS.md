This sled is designed to be cut using a temporary version of the sled.

When setting up the gcode to cut the sled you will notice that all of the bolt holes have two concentric circles.

The inner circle is indented to be cut all the way through the material, while the outer circle should be pocketed do a depth of .25 inches to allow the bolt heads to recess.
